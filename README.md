# ``Greetings, Earthlings.``

Don't worry, I won't eat you.

My name is Prannaya Gupta, but you can call me **'Prannay'** (that's just how it's pronounced).

I recently graduated from [NUS High School](https://www.nushigh.edu.sg/), having majored in Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry. I previously served as an Overall-in-Charge of [BuildingBloCS 2023](https://old.buildingblocs.sg/2023-newnew/), you may have seen me there! I was also served as the President of my school's computing club, [AppVenture](https://nush.app) back in 2023, and I served as the Club Director of my school's [Astronomy Club](https://nushastro.github.io/website/) in 2022.

I'm currently serving my mandatory two years of national service as an AI Engineer (Digital Engineer) at [RSAF's RAiD](https://rsaf-agile-inno-digital.defence.gov.sg/). I am working under the [AETHER Branch](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GLhfqexgm6xFeuRS9), based at SUTD, where we build cutting-edge experimental solutions for our airmen and airwomen at the RSAF. Currently, we're working on various technologies, including human performance monitoring headsets and multi-agentic autonomous software development tools (including a VSCode Extension for our very own RAiDers to use!). We even [published a paper at ICMCIS 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20311) on accented air traffic control speech transcription! If you're interested to potentially volunteer to work on our projects, or join us at AETHER as an intern (min. 3 months), please ping me! (on LinkedIn)

Outside of my ventures in the RSAF, I currently serve as the Youth Community Lead at the tech-for-good charity [Better.sg](https://better.sg/), where we aim to bring together tech solutions and provide tech guidance to charities, for the betterment of Singaporean society. We recently ran the [BEACON 2024](https://beacon.better.sg/) conference, which was really awesome! If you need any guidance on how to navigate through [Better.sg](https://better.sg/), my door is always open! (on LinkedIn)

In my free time outside working hours, I also volunteer to conduct research with external mentors from various universities across Singapore. Besides my own self-initiated projects (see: [Tris, published in The Physics Educator 2025](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S2661339525500015)), I have previously worked with

- [Assoc Prof Arthur Tay](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/arthur-tay/) from NUS CDE on AI Models to detect Freezing-of-Gait in Parkinson's Patients ([published in IRC-SET 2021](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-9869-9_21))
- [Asst Prof Immanuel Koh](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/profile/immanuel-koh) from SUTD DAI on Semantic Segmentation of Interior and Exterior Housing Designs
- [Assoc Prof Tram Truong-Huu](https://sites.google.com/site/htrtruong) from SIT on AI-assisted Malware Detection ([published in IEEE DASC 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10361451/)).

Most recently, I have also volunteered actively under [Walled AI Labs](https://github.com/walledai), developing [models](https://hf.co/walledai/walledguard-c), [datasets](https://hf.co/datasets/walledai/SGXSTest) and [libraries](https://github.com/walledai/walledeval) for LLM Safety under the tutelage of my mentor, [Dr Rishabh Bhardwaj](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/rishabh-bhardwaj-nlp). We recently published a paper at EMNLP 2024, under the System Demonstrations Track! Check it out [here](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-demo.42/).

I previously interned at [AI Singapore](https://aisingapore.org/) in December 2022, helping to develop a benchmarking tool for a cutting-edge startup based in the States. I also interned at [Temus](https://temus.com/) prior to my enlistment, developing the early version of the [TalentForge](https://temus.com/case-study/ai-talent-acquisition-and-development-platform/) product that won the Innovation Prize at the [Google x IMDA AI Trailblazers Programme in Jan 2024](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/watch/googles-ai-trailblazers-programme-aims-help-firms-find-tech-solutions-video-4083086) (while I was on Tekong ðŸ¤¡).

That's it for this bio, thanks for reading through this giant chunk of text!
