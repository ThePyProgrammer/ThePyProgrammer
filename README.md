# ``Greetings, Earthlings.``

Don't worry, I won't eat you.

My name is Prannaya Gupta, but you can call me **'Prannay'** (that's just how it's pronounced).

I recently graduated from [NUS High School](https://www.nushigh.edu.sg/), having majored in Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry. I previously served as an Overall-in-Charge of [BuildingBloCS 2023](https://old.buildingblocs.sg/2023-newnew/), you may have seen me there! I was also served as the President of my school's computing club, [AppVenture](https://nush.app) back in 2023, and I served as the Club Director of my school's [Astronomy Club](https://nushastro.github.io/website/) in 2022.

I'm currently an AI Engineer (Digital Engineer) at [RSAF's RAiD](https://rsaf-agile-inno-digital.defence.gov.sg/), serving my 2-year mandatory national service. I am working under the [AETHER Branch](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GLhfqexgm6xFeuRS9), based at SUTD, where we build cutting-edge experimental solutions for our airmen and airwomen at the RSAF. Currently, we're building various tools, including human performance monitoring headsets and multi-agentic autonomous software development tools (including a VSCode Extension for our very own RAiDers to use!). If you're interested to potentially volunteer to work on our projects, or join us at AETHER as an intern (min. 3 months), please ping me! (on LinkedIn)

Outside of my ventures in the RSAF, I currently serve as the Youth Community Lead at the tech-for-good charity [Better.sg](https://better.sg/), where we aim to bring together tech solutions and provide tech guidance to charities, for the betterment of Singaporean society. We recently ran the [BEACON 2024](https://beacon.better.sg/) conference, where [Better.sg](https://better.sg/) officially partnered with [The Majurity Trust](https://www.majurity.sg/) for our AI/ML for Good Mentorship Programme! You should check it out. If you need any guidance on how to navigate through [Better.sg](https://better.sg/), my door is always open! (on LinkedIn)

I have previously worked actively under Walled AI Labs, developing models, [datasets](https://hf.co/datasets/walledai/SGXSTest) and [libraries](https://github.com/walledai/walledeval) for LLM Safety under the tutelage of my mentor, (soon-to-be-Dr) Rishabh Bhardwaj. We recently published a paper at EMNLP 2024, under the System Demonstrations Track! Check it out [here](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-demo.42/). We are actively looking for people interested in LLM Safety to join us in our research process, so if you're interested, hit me up! (also on LinkedIn)

That's it for this bio, thanks for reading through this huge chunk of text!
